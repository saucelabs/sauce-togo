## Run tests on your infrastructure and see the results in Sauce Labs

Start a Selenium Grid in seconds! Run your tests, and visualize your test results in 
the Sauce Labs dashboard.

Without any extra configuration needed, test results include screenshots, logs, and videos.

Sauce To Go builds on top [docker-selenium](https://github.com/seleniumhq/docker-selenium/)
to run your tests on Firefox, Edge, or Chrome. When tests complete, Sauce To Go uploads all 
screenshots, logs and videos to Sauce Labs. You will be able to see tests results after 
logging into your Sauce Labs account.

## Why?

### It is hard to manage test logs and videos

[docker-selenium](https://github.com/seleniumhq/docker-selenium/) is great to run a Selenium 
Grid that records videos out of the box. Yet, it is not easy to manage, store and visualize 
all the generated files after executing tests. We all want a good-looking test results dashboard!

### Missing analytics and insights 

Test results provide big amounts of invaluable data that can answer important questions. 
Which tests are failing often? What trends can I see in my tests? What is my slowest test?

We need a clear Analytics and Insights dashboard to help us understand how our tests behave.

### Sharing test results and bug reporting

We work in teams, we collaborate with people. Sharing test results with our team will us 
to understand our application status. Yet, getting all the files needed to share a test 
result or to create a bug report can be challenging.

Test results should be in a central and secure place. This allows us to share them under 
the right permissions or to create a Jira bug report with a single click.


## Goals

- Generate more valuable test results to help users understand their application status
- Get value from test results data through Sauce Labs Insights and Analytics
- Offer users a single view for all executed tests, either on their infrastructure or on Sauce Labs
